\chapter{Calculation: Power Budget} \label{App:PowerBudget}

The following power budget was adapted from the 2014 senior design team, updated with the new hardware that we plan to add to the rover \cite{rslrover2014}. We hope to attain a more accurate understanding of how much power each component draws at the quarter progresses as we can measure the current draw of each component and update the spreadsheet.
