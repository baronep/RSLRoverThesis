\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}

Our Senior Design team sought to design and implement an unmanned vehicle that can gather and relay information about a post-fire environment back to its operator so that humans do not have to place their lives in danger to do so. Our team has identified five key subsystem that when combined will create a fully functioning vehicle fit to meet our goal.  These subsystems are environment sensing, user interface, communications, power and localization.

Overall, we believe that our design is adequate to solve the problem.  Our design provides the necessary tools to give operators the ability to investigate a post-fire environment without placing themselves in immediate danger.  The sensor packages, like the air particulate sensors and thermal imaging, will provide data on the most dangerous of the potential hazardous in the area.  Our user-interface will make it easy for operators to both drive the vehicle and view the incoming data from these sensor packages so that operators can quickly identify potential hazards.

The one area in which our design is lacking is in the communications subsystem.  Due to budget constraints, we are relying on a short range peer-to-peer wifi connection to communicate with the vehicle.  This works for prototyping the functions of the vehicle, but future teams should consider upgrading the communication subsystem to something that has a larger ranger and greater reliability.  

Our very first designs also included making the vehicle fully autonomous; however, we quickly realized that this was an ambitious and unrealistic goal.  Future teams could make use of the localization subsystem and the Robotic Operating System which we plan on using to upgrade the vehicle from an unmanned vehicle to a fully autonomous vehicle.  All of our design decisions tried to keep this ultimate goal of full vehicle autonomy in mind.  Our team recognizes that while we will not be able to make the vehicle fully autonomous, we are a critical part of making this goal happen. We are now the third team to have worked on this vehicle and we hope that future teams will be able to reuse and improve upon our design.

%TODO BEEF UP CONCLUSION

%So far, we have repaired the vehicle since we received it in an inoperable state. We are still running into minor issues that have caused short-lived setbacks in implementation, but we hope to have the vehicle assessed by a professional mechanic. We have also created web-based vehicle controls. A user can control the vehicle with an Xbox controller through a web page. In addition, we have itegrated a high level operating system (ROS), mounted a fully operable LiDAR, and have improved the overall power architecture. These are critical preliminary steps that will hopefully make further implementation go smoothly.
