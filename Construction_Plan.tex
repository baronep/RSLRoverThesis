\chapter{Construction Plan}

Our team spent the first 11 weeks of the school year planning the scope and finalizing our design and requirements for the RSL Rover: Disaster Response and Reconnaissance Vehicle. As early as December, we began purchasing the bulk of our sensors so that we could begin our next stage of prototyping as early as the first week of winter quarter. Our major milestones, including prototype deadlines and testing schedules, are outlined in the Gantt Chart in Appendix \ref{App:Gantt}. 

Each team member took ownership of a specific subsystem or task and purchased and prototyped over winter break. We began to  integrate the remaining sensors required for localization in January as well as manufactured the housing and mountings for our environmental sensing sensors. By the end of winter quarter, we completed a first iteration of all hardware, including electronics and mounting, in order to iterate on that design in the Spring if necessary. 

%While we intend to stick to this deadline, we are aware that unexpected slowdowns can occur. We anticipate having occasional mechanical issues with the vehicle, however the team is becoming more accustomed to the nuances of the system and continue to fix bugs and make improvements to the previous year's designs.
