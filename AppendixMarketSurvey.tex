{}Need Category & Need & Description & Priority & Justification \\
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Communication} & Strong Communication Link & Vehicle must have a strong communication link both to the operators as well as to mobile command station & LOW & Communication links are expensive COTS solutions, our senior design is a proof of concept, not a marketable product.\\ \cline{2-5}

& Clear Effective Data Presentation & Sensor data must be presented in such a way that the first responder can quickly and easily extract useful information & HIGH & Information presentation is key functionality which is necessary in a proof of concept \\ \hline

\multirow{5}{*}{Sensors} & Imaging Sensors & An array of thermal imaging cameras, LIDAR, and video feeds that work in many visibility conditions & HIGH & The vehicle awareness from the cameras is key to the proof of concept vehicle.  \\ \cline{2-5}
& Combustible Gas Indicator (CGI) & First responders need to be aware of any potentially explosive gasses present at a disaster site & MEDIUM & We can include inexpensive senors to search for some gasses but more comprehensive sensors are outside of our price range \\ \cline{2-5}
& Air Particulate (Smoke) & Accurate smoke levels provide first responders information about the survivability of an area for unprotected individuals & HIGH & Air particulate sensors are within our price range and provide valuable information \\ \cline{2-5}
& Temperature & Temperature sensors provide information about danger levels especially in forest fire fighting operations & HIGH & Sensor is readily available and provides useful information to the first responder \\ \cline{2-5}
& Geiger Counter & The geiger counter would provide useful information but only in specific disaster scenarios & MEDIUM & While the data would be interesting, the sensor is expensive it is not necessary for a proof of concept. \\ \hline

\multirow{5}{*}{Vehicle} & Off-Road Capable & The vehicle must be able to reasonably traverse obstacles while remaining nimble & HIGH & The RSL Rover platform is already tailored for off-road applications \\ \cline{2-5}
& Weather/ Temperature Resistant & This is especially important for fire fighting operations. Heat shielding would be invaluable for these instances & LOW & Heat shielding would be very expensive and can be added for a post-prototype vehicle \\ \cline{2-5}
& High Angle of Attack & The vehicle needs to be able to climb hills and over debris & MEDIUM & The RSL Rover vehicle platform already has this capability \\ \cline{2-5}
& Long Range & The range of the vehicle directly impacts the type of operations that it can participate in.  & HIGH & The RSL Rover vehicle was designed with an extended gas tank (greater than 20 gal) \\ \cline{2-5}
& Power Supplies & The vehicle must be able to incorporate application specific sensors & HIGH & We can provide excess power and communication facilities for extra sensors to be integrated \\ \hline
