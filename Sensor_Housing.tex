\chapter{Subsystem: Sensor Housing}

\section{Need for Housing} Our vehicle, being equipped with multiple sensors, including sensors for air particulates, natural gas, petroleum gas, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas, needs to protect the sensors from physical elements that could damage them while also ensuring they are installed such that the sensors are exposed to the elements they are meant to detect. We decided to house these sensors together in one housing unit. This unit serves to shield the sensors from any physical interferences.

\section{Materials Used} The material for the housing unit needed to be relatively sturdy to protect the sensors, cheap and easy to machine for economic efficiency, and thermally resistant to protect our sensors from high heat. After researching many materials, acrylic was decided upon for the material to construct our housing structure. See Figure \ref{tab:Acrylic Properties} for the favorable characteristics of acrylic. 

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Property & Associated Value \\\hline
Thermal Conductivity & 1.3 to 1.5 $\frac{Btu-in}{hr-ft^2-\deg F}$ \\
Melting Temperature & 464 to 473 $\deg$ F \\
Compressive Strength & 14100 to 18000 psi \\
Tensile Strength & 5420 to 10700 psi \\
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Acrylic has relatively low thermal conductivity, meaning it can insulate our sensors effectively, and it's melting temperature is far above the maximum of 250$\deg F$ that we expect our vehicle to experience. Though we do not expect our unit to be under a great deal of mechanical stress, as the most stress our housing unit will be in is under the stress of its own weight, the compressive and tensile strengths are both well above the weight of the system. The price of acrylic is relatively cheap compared to other plastics of comparable properties, and it is very easy to machine and assemble through the use of adhesives.

\section{Initial Design}

The first question that we addressed in the design of the housing was how do we force the air into the housing unit? Though our housing unit is designed to protect our sensors from many of the outside elements, our sensors require exposure to air. We decided to use a PWM fan for its speed control and relatively small size. The model we used is the Artic F9 Case fan, which reaches a maximum air flow of 31 $ft^{3}/min$. For our initial iterations of the design, our team decided to use the fan as an outlet for airflow, pulling air through our housing unit.

The next question facing our team concerned the means by which air could flow over and through our sensors. Figures \ref{fig:airflow1} and \ref{fig:airflow2} show the unique air flow needs of the sensors we used. Most of our sensors simply needed air to flow over them, as shown in Figure 4.1. Our air particulate sensor, however, needed air to rise through a very specific segment, as demonstrated in Figure 4.2. Due to this, our housing design needed to account for these means of air flow.  Our initial design had two main inlet holes, one on the front of the unit, and one on the underside. The front inlet was designed to be the major inlet of air to fill  our housing unit. Our bottom hole was designed specifically to intake air, pushing air directly through the air particulate sensor.

\end{figure}

The major question we were left with was, will the air flow where we want the air to flow? For this a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) test was performed on our design.

\section{CFD Analysis and Iterative Work}

Ansys Workbench was used to perform a series of tasks designed to complete a CFD analysis. The first task was to design the internal space of the feature. This means designing a part that would represent only the area inside the housing unit. Figure \ref{fig:intspace} shows the design of said part.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{CFDSolid.jpg}
	\caption{The solid designed for the initial CFD analysis that shows the initial design}
	\label{fig:intspace}
\end{figure}

After this internal space was designed, a mesh was created around the part using Ansys Workbench. Once the mesh was created and reformatted to be as precise as possible, boundary conditions could be set. No-slip conditions were set on all of the walls of the part. The inlets of the part were set at ambient pressure of 1 atm. The outlet was given a constant outlet velocity, calculated from converting the 31 ft$^{3}$/min of the fan into a usable velocity of 2.6 m/sec; then this was computed by dividing the flow rate by the area of the fan and converting feet to meters. From there, a streamline map was developed for the system in order to show how successful our design was.

Our streamline map in Figure \ref{fig:CFD1} pointed out some key failings of our initial design. Though we were successful in driving air up the hole dedicated to feeding our air particulate sensor, we were unable to fill the area of the housing unit where most of our other sensors would be placed. Instead of the air filling up the empty space, only a few streamlines reached the center of our housing unit; many of our streamlines clung to the edge of our design.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{CFDhalf.jpg}
	\caption{CFD streamline analysis for our first design}
	\label{fig:CFD1}
\end{figure}

In our second iteration, we attempted the same tests while adding a second inlet hole on the opposite side of the housing unit to our primary inlet. This was added to push air streams into the streams currently clinging to the wall of our unit in order to send air through the central area of our housing unit, where the gas sensors would most likely be. While this did move air more successfully through our system than the prior design, Figure \ref{fig:CFD2} shows there were still deficiencies in the streamlines as vorticies were created as the streams collided.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{CFD.jpg}
	\caption{CFD streamline analysis for our second design}
	\label{fig:CFD2}
\end{figure}

In our final iteration, we attempted to use the PWM fan as an air inlet instead, and we received positive results from our CFD analysis. The use of the fan as an inlet caused the streamlines to be smooth throughout most of the system until exiting through the three outlet holes, the two primary outlets and the secondary outlet dedicated to the air particulate sensor. The streamlines shown in Figure \ref{fig:CFD3} show the air exiting directly through the air particulate sensor still, while also driving air smoothly over the area where our gas sensors would be located. From this design, we built our acrylic prototypes.

\section{Final Design}
Three housing units were made and nicknamed Larry, Curly and Moe. Each was fitted with our dedicated PCBs, which had been fitted with our gas sensors, the air particulate sensor, an Arduino unit to process the data, and the PWM fan. These fully equipped sensor units were then fitted to the roll cage of the vehicle. Two units, Larry and Moe, were installed on the right and left side of the upper bar of the front cage, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Box}. Allowing air to be pulled in on both sides of the vehicle. The remaining unit, Curly, was placed at the center-front of the overhead roll cage to draw air in from the front of the vehicle. This mounting strategy protected the sensor cases and allowed air intakes from all three directions of concern around the vehicle. It also created an aesthetically pleasing look.
